<meta name="description" content="Forms are one of the best features of Django. (After models, admin, url routing etc :) ). Here is a quick tutorial describing how to do things with Django forms. Basic form Prob. You want to show a form, validate it and display it. Ans. Create a simple form. class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() joined_on = forms.DateField() This wil take care that the form is displayed with two text field, and a value for them are filled in, and the second field has correct formatting for a date. 2. Prob. Create a form which has values populated depending upon a runtime value, eg you might want to show only the values corresponding to the current subdomain. Ans. Create a form with an custom __init__. class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() plan = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset = Plan.objects.none()) def __init__(self, subdomain, *args, **kwargs): self.default_username = default_username super(UserForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.fields[&#39;plan&#39;].queryset = Plan.objects.filter(subdomain = subdomain) Here in the __init__ we are overriding the default queryset on field plan. Any of the attributes can similarly be overridden. However the self.fields is populated only after super(UserForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs) is called. 3. Prob. The same form is used in multiple views, and handles the cleaned_data similarly. Ans. Create a form with a custom .save() class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() def save(self): data = self.cleaned_data user = User.objects.create(username = data[&#39;username&#39;]) #create a profile UserProfile.objects.create(user = user, ...some more data...) You could have called this method anything, but this is generally called save, to maintain similarity with ModelForm 4. Prob. You need to create a form with fields which have custom validations. Ans. Create a form with custom clean_fieldname class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() def clean_username(self): data = self.cleaned_data try: User.objects.get(username = data[&#39;username&#39;]) except User.DoesNotExist: return data[&#39;username&#39;] raise forms.ValidationError(&#39;This username is already taken.&#39;) Here we can validate that the usernames are not repeated. 5. Prob. You want to create a field which has cross field validations. Ans. Create a field with a .clean class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() password1 = forms.PasswordField() password2 = forms.PasswordField() def clean(self): data = self.cleaned_data if &quot;password1&quot; in data and &quot;password2&quot; in data and data[&quot;password1&quot;] != data[&quot;password2&quot;]: raise forms.ValudationError(&quot;Passwords must be same&quot;) 6. Problem. You need a form the fields of which depends on some value in the database. Eg. The field to be shown are customisable per user. Create a form dynamically def get_user_form_for_user(user): class UserForm(forms.Form): username = forms.CharField() fields = user.get_profile().all_field() #Use field to find what to show. This post provides much more details 7. Prob. You need to create a Html form which writes to multiple Django models. Ans. Django forms are not a one to one mapping to Html forms. #in forms.py class UserForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = User fields = [&quot;username&quot;, &quot;email&quot;] class UserProfileForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = UserProfile #in views.py def add_user(request): ... if request.method == &quot;POST&quot;: uform = UserForm(data = request.POST) pform = UserProfileForm(data = request.POST) if uform.is_valid() and pform.is_valid(): user = uform.save() profile = pform.save(commit = False) profile.user = user profile.save() .... ... #in template &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; ...&gt; &lt;/form&gt; 8. Prob. You want to use multiple forms of same type on one page. Ans. a. If you want a datagrid style ui, use formset. from django.forms.formsets import formset_factory forms = formset_factory(UserForm, extra = 4) # [Formsets are described much more comprehensively here](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/) b. If you do not need a datagrid style ui, use prefix argument to forms. Eg. you have a survey app, and you want a page with all questions from that survey displayed. #IN views.py def survey(request, survey_slug) ... questions = survey.questions.all() question_forms = [] for question in questions: qform = QuestionForm(question=question, prefix = question.slug) question_forms.append(qform) ... if request.method == &quot;POST&quot;: for question in questions: qform = QuestionForm(question=question, prefix = question.slug, data = request.POST) #Validate and do save action ... ...

    <p>Forms are one of the best features of Django. (After models, admin, url routing etc :) ). Here is a quick tutorial describing how to do things with Django forms.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Basic form</li>
</ol>

<p>Prob. You want to show a form, validate it and display it.</p>

<p>Ans. Create a simple form.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    joined_on = forms.DateField()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This wil take care that the form is displayed with two text field,
and a value for them are filled in, and the second field has correct formatting for a date.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>Prob. Create a form which has values populated depending upon a runtime value,
eg you might want to show only the values corresponding to the current subdomain.</p>

<p>Ans. Create a form with an custom <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    plan = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset = Plan.objects.none())
    
    def __init__(self, subdomain, *args, **kwargs):
        self.default_username = default_username
        super(UserForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['plan'].queryset = Plan.objects.filter(subdomain = subdomain)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code> we are overriding the default queryset on field <code class="highlighter-rouge">plan</code>. Any of the attributes can similarly be overridden.</p>

<p>However the <code class="highlighter-rouge">self.fields</code> is populated only after <code class="highlighter-rouge">super(UserForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)</code> is called.</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>Prob. The same form is used in multiple views, and handles the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cleaned_data</code> similarly.</p>

<p>Ans. Create a form with a custom .save()</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    
    def save(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data
        user = User.objects.create(username = data['username'])
        #create a profile
        UserProfile.objects.create(user = user, ...some more data...)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could have called this method anything, but this is generally called save, to maintain similarity with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ModelForm</code></p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>Prob. You need to create a form with fields which have custom validations.</p>

<p>Ans. Create a form with custom clean_fieldname</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    
    def clean_username(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data
        try:
            User.objects.get(username = data['username'])
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return data['username']
        raise forms.ValidationError('This username is already taken.')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we can validate that the usernames are not repeated.</p>

<p>5.</p>

<p>Prob. You want to create a field which has cross field validations.</p>

<p>Ans. Create a field with a .clean</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    
    password1 = forms.PasswordField()
    password2 = forms.PasswordField()
    
    def clean(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data
        if "password1" in data and "password2" in data and data["password1"] != data["password2"]:
            raise forms.ValudationError("Passwords must be same")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>6.</p>

<p>Problem.</p>

<p>You need a form the fields of which depends on some value in the database.
Eg. The field to be shown are customisable per user.</p>

<p>Create a form dynamically</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def get_user_form_for_user(user):
        class UserForm(forms.Form):
            username = forms.CharField()
            fields = user.get_profile().all_field()
            #Use field to find what to show.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="http://uswaretech.com/blog/2008/10/dynamic-forms-with-django/">This post provides much more details</a></p>

<p>7.</p>

<p>Prob. You need to create a Html form which writes to multiple Django models.</p>

<p>Ans. Django forms are not a one to one mapping to Html forms.</p>

<p>Prob. You want to use multiple forms of same type on one page.</p>

<p>Ans.</p>

<p>a. If you want a datagrid style ui, use formset.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from django.forms.formsets import formset_factory
forms = formset_factory(UserForm, extra = 4)
# [Formsets are described much more comprehensively here](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>b. If you do not need a datagrid style ui, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">prefix</code> argument to forms.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Eg. you have a survey app, and you want a page with all questions from that survey displayed.

#IN views.py
def survey(request, survey_slug)
    ...
    questions = survey.questions.all()
    question_forms = []
    for question in questions:
        qform = QuestionForm(question=question, prefix = question.slug)
        question_forms.append(qform)
        ...
    if request.method == "POST":
        for question in questions:
            qform = QuestionForm(question=question, prefix = question.slug, data = request.POST)
        #Validate and do save action
        ...
    ...
</code></pre></div></div>
