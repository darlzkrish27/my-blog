<p>Iterables are objects that implement the iterator protocol.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class A(object):
	def __iter__(self):
		return B()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An instance of A would be an iterable, because class A has __iter__() defined on it.</p>

<p>__iter__ method mandates that an <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterator</code> be returned from it. Instance of class B must be an iterator. More on iterators to follow. <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterator</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterables</code> are different things.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a = A()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here “a” is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterable</code>. It is not an <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterator</code>.</p>

<p>There is a built-in method called <code class="highlighter-rouge">iter()</code>. Only iterables can be passed to built in method <code class="highlighter-rouge">iter()</code>. If we try to pass a non-iterable to iter(), a TypeError will occur. More on built-in method iter() to follow.</p>

<p>Passing an iterable to built in <code class="highlighter-rouge">iter()</code> causes __iter__() of the iterable to be called.</p>

<h4 id="iterator">Iterator</h4>

<p>An iterator is an object that has next() method defined.</p>

<p>An iterator doesn’t need to have __iter__() defined. Similarly an iterable doesn’t need to have next() defined.</p>

<p>To reiterate, iterable must have __iter__() defined and iterator must have next() defined.</p>

<p>Iterator class B could look like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class B(object):
	def next(self):
		return "boom"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Class B is an iterator because it has method next().</p>

<p>You can do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a_instance = A()	
a_iter = iter(a_instance)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">a_instance</code> is an iterable because it has method __iter__. Calling built-in iter() on the iterable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a_instance</code> internally called a_instance.__iter__(). a_instance.__iter__() returned an iterator which is an instance of class B.</p>

<h4 id="built-in-next-and-built-in-iter">Built-in next() and built-in iter()</h4>

<p>Built in method <code class="highlighter-rouge">next()</code> mandates that an iterator be passed to it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [33]: next(a_iter)
Out[33]: 'boom'

In [34]: next(a_iter)
Out[34]: 'boom'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>next() works with an iterator. next() doesn’t work with iterable. Try it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [60]: iterable = A()

In [61]: next(iterable)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-61-edd1adac5cd0&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 next(iterable)

TypeError: A object is not an iterator

In [65]: iterator = B()

In [66]: next(iterator)
Out[66]: 'boom'

In [67]: next(iterator)
Out[67]: 'boom'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>iter() works with iterable. iter() doesn’t work with iterators.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [73]: iter(iterable)
Out[73]: &lt;__main__.B at 0x1058cef50&gt;

In [74]: iter(iterator)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-74-035e65827850&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 iter(iterator)

TypeError: 'B' object is not iterable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An iterable needs an underlying iterator. In our examples, iterable A needs underlying iterator B.</p>

<p>At the same time iterators are independent of iterables. B isn’t dependent on A.</p>

<p>Let’s create a class which is not an iterable i.e which doesn’t have __iter__() implemented and try to use it with built in iter().</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [44]: class NotIterable(object):
	...:     pass
	...:

In [45]: iter(NotIterable())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-45-a8708f85a52f&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 iter(NotIterable())

TypeError: 'NotIterable' object is not iterable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Built in iter() can only work with an iterable. And calling iter(iterable) returns an iterator.</p>

<h4 id="stopiteration">StopIteration</h4>

<p>When using iterators, there is a related concept called StopIteration.</p>

<p>Currently every time you call next() on an instance of B, “boom” is returned. Suppose you only want “boom” to be returned 3 times, then you can do.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [79]: class B(object):
	...:     def __init__(self):
	...:         self.i = 0
	...:     def next(self):
	...:         if self.i == 3:
	...:             raise StopIteration()
	...:         self.i += 1
	...:         return "boom"

In [81]: next(b_instance)
Out[81]: 'boom'

In [82]: next(b_instance)
Out[82]: 'boom'

In [83]: next(b_instance)
Out[83]: 'boom'

In [84]: next(b_instance)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-84-95c74b691bf4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 next(b_instance)

&lt;ipython-input-79-700035006973&gt; in next(self)
	  4     def next(self):
	  5         if self.i == 3:
----&gt; 6             raise StopIteration()
	  7         self.i += 1
	  8         return "boom"

StopIteration:
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="how-for-loop-works">How for loop works</h4>

<p>For loop expects an iterable to be passed to it. Assuming the classes look like the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [89]: class B(object):
	...:     def next(self):
	...:         return "boom"
	...:

In [89]: class A(object):
	...:     def __iter__(self):
	...:         return B()
	...:

In [89]: iterable = A()

In [89]: for each in iterable:
	...:     print each
	...:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would keep printing “boom”. What happened here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saying <code class="highlighter-rouge">for each in iterable</code> causes iter(iterable) to be called. This returns the underlying iterator.</li>
  <li>Then next() of iterator is repeatedly called until next() of iterator raises a StopIteration.</li>
  <li>Since in this case StopIteration() is never raised from the iterator, so “boom” keeps on getting returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case we only want “boom” to be printed 3 times, we could do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [89]: class B(object):
	...:     def __init__(self):
	...:         self.i = 0 # Hard coded currently, but can be made configurable
	...:     def next(self):
	...:         if self.i == 3:
	...:             raise StopIteration()
	...:         self.i += 1
	...:         return "boom"
	...:

In [90]: iterable = A()

In [91]: for each in iterable:
	...:     print each
	...:
boom
boom
boom
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here StopIteration() was raised after next() of iterator ran for 3 times. So <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop only printed “boom” 3 times.</p>

<h5 id="how-lists-work-with-for-loop">How lists work with for loop</h5>

<p>Python lists are iterables. Internally lists implement the __iter__() method. And __iter__() of list returns an iterator which has a next() method.</p>

<p>You can verify that a list object has __iter__():</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [92]: l = [1, 2, 3]

In [93]: l.__iter__
Out[93]: &lt;method-wrapper '__iter__' of list object at 0x1058eaa28&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s get the corresponding iterator for this iterable.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [94]: iterator_for_list = iter(l)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we are expecting it to be an iterator, there must be a method next() on this object.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [99]: iterator_for_list.next
Out[99]: &lt;method-wrapper 'next' of listiterator object at 0x1058dd610&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Calling next() on this object will return different elements of list. When no more elements are left, a StopIteration() would be raised</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In [102]: iterator_for_list.next()
Out[102]: 1

In [103]: iterator_for_list.next()
Out[103]: 2

In [104]: iterator_for_list.next()
Out[104]: 3

In [105]: iterator_for_list.next()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-105-3adc9ab4c81f&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 iterator_for_list.next()

StopIteration:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because iterator protocol is implemented on a list, that’s why we are able to iterate over a list.</p>
