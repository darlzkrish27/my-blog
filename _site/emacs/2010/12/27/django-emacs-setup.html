    <p>My colleague Javed had written a fantastic article a short while back on
<a href="http://agiliq.com/blog/2010/11/seven-reasons-why-you-should-switch-to-vim-for-dja/">"Seven reasons why you should switch to
Vim"</a>
and as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emacs">emacs</a> user I thought I
should share my setup too. One of the coolest things at
<a href="http://agiliq.com/">Agiliq</a> is that we are free to use the development
tools of our choice. As a case to explain the point, everyone at agiliq
uses a different editor and if someday a flame war would escalate to the
third world war, I assure you it would start from Agiliq ;-)</p>

<p>Though I have been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emacs">emacs</a> for
more than two years now, I still am an amateur. In this post, I am not
going to exhort you to switch to emacs but explain my setup.</p>

<p>If you are planning to give emacs a try, I would suggest you start with
the inbuilt emacs tutorial (C-h t). After you've gone through the
tutorial, start using emacs while noting your most repetitive actions.
Later, bind these repetitive actions to suitable shortcuts so that you
can maximize your productivity and reduce keystrokes. Whenever in doubt,
refer to <a href="http://emacswiki.org">emacswiki</a> for clarifications. Another
wonderful reference would be <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=steve+yegge+emacs">Steve
Yegge's</a> articles on emacs.</p>

<p>Before I explain my setup, let me make it clear that most editors
already have a lot of the functionality and I am not being judgemental
in this post. If you've come here to see me bash other editors or
proclaim that emacs is the best editor, you are going to be
disappointed. Emacs has worked for me and a lot of other people and may
work for you. Give a couple of editors out there in the market a try
(atleast for a fortnight for each editor) and decide the one that you
are most comfortable with.</p>

<p>I use emacs without a window system (emacs -nw) and have an alias entry
in my .bashrc to load it in this mode by default.</p>

<p>Here are the contents on my .emacs.d/init.el file and I will explain
them below line by line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>;; .emacs

;; enable visual feedback on selections
(setq transient-mark-mode t)

;;; interfacing with ELPA, the package archive.
;;; Move this code earlier if you want to reference
;;; packages in your .emacs.
(when
    (load
     (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa/package.el"))
  (package-initialize))

;; My customizations
(ido-mode 1)
(icomplete-mode 1)

(setq tags-file-name "~/TAGS")
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f5&gt;") 'find-tag)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f6&gt;") 'rgrep)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f7&gt;") 'magit-status)

(setq yas/root-directory "~/.emacs.d/snippets")
(yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)

(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/multi-term.el"))
(require 'multi-term)
(setq multi-term-program "/bin/bash")
(multi-term)
(defalias 'term 'multi-term)

(defun build-tags ()
  (interactive)
  (call-process-shell-command 
      "find ~/django_projects/ -name '*.py' -print \" \
      "|xargs etags -o ~/TAGS" 
      nil (get-buffer-create "Etags Compile") 1)
  )
(defalias 'etb 'build-tags)

(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The transient-mark-mode symbol when enabled gives feedback while marking
regions (highlighting selected regions).</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://tromey.com/elpa/">ELPA</a> (Emacs Lisp Package Archive) for
installing and managing my packages. Though currently, there are a few
packages only in ELPA, they've been sufficient for me. There's another
emacs package manager that I am looking forward to called
<a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/epkg">epkg</a> which will install packages
from the <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror">EmacsMirror</a>.</p>

<p>I have a few modes enabled by default like
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings">ido-mode</a> (for
intelligent auto completion in the minibuffer),
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IcompleteMode">icomplete-mode</a> (for
helping me complete commands in the minibuffer without remembering the
full names), column-number-mode (to display the column number at which
the point is currently located, useful if you follow PEP-8 for python)
and disable the menu-bar as I hardly use it. The menu-bar is a
distraction especially when you are using emacs on a separate display in
a maximized state.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsTags">emacs tags</a> to jump
between function calls and definitions very frequently and hence bound
this invocation to the F5 key. One thing to note is that F5-F9 are
generally unassigned and can be bound to your most frequently used
actions.</p>

<p>I also search very often for files or content within files and use
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GrepMode">rgrep</a> and this has been bound
to the F6 key.</p>

<p>I use git a lot and hence use
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit">magit</a>, a fantastic emacs mode to
interact with <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a>. This mode has been bound to the
F7 key of the keyboard.</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of auto-complete but use some snippet based
auto-completion using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/">yasnippets</a>.
It's very easy to write your own snippets and I've written lots of
them for django and some dom elements.</p>

<p>Whenever I start emacs, I also start a shell and
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/multi-term.el">multi-term</a> is
very useful in this regard. It handles unicode and ncurses based output
very well. This is where I run the django development server or deploy
using the fabric scripts.</p>

<p>Apart from these elisp packages, I run
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC">erc</a> (an IRC client written for
emacs) occasionally to lurk on
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/django">#django</a>. I manage my tasks using the
<a href="http://orgmode.org/org.html">org-mode</a> and synchronize these tasks with
my home workstation using the <a href="http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/">mobileorg</a>
android app and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">dropbox</a>.</p>

<p>As you would've observed my emacs setup is fairly minimal but suffices
most of my django and python development. If you are an emacs user and
have tips for me and other users, leave your comments. There's always a
lot to learn in emacs :)</p>
