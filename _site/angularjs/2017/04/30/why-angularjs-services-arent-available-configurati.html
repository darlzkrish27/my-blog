    <p>This post explains why services aren’t available in configuration blocks.</p>

<p>AngularJS has a concept of $injector which has a function called invoke().</p>

<p>AngularJS has two injectors. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>instanceInjector</li>
  <li>providerInjector</li>
</ul>

<p>When we say $injector, most of the times we mean instanceInjector. You can read more about injectors in <a href="http://agiliq.com/blog/2017/04/angularjs-injectors-internals/" target="_blank">our last post</a>.</p>

<p>instanceInjector, or what we generally call $injector, can provide access to a service in either of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>instantiate the service. Once instantiated instanceInjector caches the service</li>
  <li>get the service from cache if its alreay in cache</li>
</ul>

<p>At low level, Controller or Service code is executed by $injector.invoke(). And this $injector knows a way to reach the services in one of the two ways mentioned above.</p>

<p>During configuration phase, i.e when configuration block is executed, $injector i.e instanceInjector isn’t available. So instanceInjector cache isn’t available too and so services aren’t accessible in configuration blocks.</p>

<p>Try to access a service in configuration block and it will fail:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>angular.module("core", []);
angular
	.module("core")
	.service("ProfileService", function () {
		var profile = {'name': 'hardcoded name'};
		return {
			'profile': profile;
		}
	});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try to access this service in config block</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>angular
	.module("core")
	.config(["ProfileService", function (ProfileService) {
	}]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This failed because $injector isn’t available when config block executed.</p>

<p>Also there shouldn’t be a need to access services in configuration blocks. Configuration blocks are meant to configure things, eg: to configure a constant which will be used throughout the angular app. And services are meant to keep business logic. There shouldn’t be need to use business logic during configuration phase.</p>
