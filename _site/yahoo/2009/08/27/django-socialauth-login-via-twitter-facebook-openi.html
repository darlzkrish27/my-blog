<p>This is a application to enable authentication via various third party sites.
In particular it allows logging in via</p>

<ol>
  <li>Twitter</li>
  <li>Gmail</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Yahoo(Essentially openid)</li>
  <li>OpenId</li>

  <li><a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/">python-oauth</a>(<code class="highlighter-rouge">easy_install</code>)</li>

<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works.</h4>

<p>Openid: Users need to provide their openid providers. Talk to the providers and
login.<br />
Yahoo: Yahoo is an openid provider. Talk to Yahoo endpoints. (Endpoint: http://yahoo.com)<br />
Google: Google is a provider. Talk to them. (Endpoint: https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id)<br />
Facebook: Facebook connect provides authentication framework.<br />
Twitter: We use Twitter Oauth for authentication. In theory, Oauth shouldn’t be
used for authentication. (It is an autorisation framework, not an authentication one),
In practice it works pretty well. Once you have an access_token, and a name, essentially
authenticated.</p>
