<meta name="description" content="Imagine this, you want to solve a problem, the algorithm for which you do not know. You just know the problem. From wikipedia, Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found. Assume that there exists an alternate world where you only need to specify the problem, the computer will find out an algorithm to find it, even better if could you write it in Python. Stop assuming it hapens every day, and this is the magic of constraint programming. Example to solve a + b = 5, a*b=6, don’t explain algebra, just tell the relations between variables. Here is the complete program. from constraint import * problem = Problem() problem.addVariable(&#39;a&#39;, range(5)) problem.addVariable(&#39;b&#39;, range(5)) problem.addConstraint(lambda a, b: a + b == 5) problem.addConstraint(lambda a, b: a * b == 6) problem.getSolutions() Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense yet, we will explain it in a lot of detail.

Download and install python-constraint from here. After you setup, you should be able to do import constraint on a python shell On to our program Ok lets see the same program with cpomments. from constraint import * #imports problem = Problem() #Create a blank problem where we can add solutions. problem.addVariable(&#39;a&#39;, range(5+1)) #Add a variable named a, and specify its domain.

Not much to explain after you see it with comments. We created two variables, and relation between them and got the answer. Ok something better Ok so the last example was cute, but can constraint programming can solve any harder problems? Lets try something harder, like umm, magic square. (How, original!) So lets think, how can we represent our problem. We have a n*n board. Start with 3, So our board is [(0,0), (0,1) …., (2,1), (2,2) Rows have a sum of sum(1 …. n*n+1)/size Cols have a sum of sum(1 …. n*n+1)/size Diagonals have a sum of sum(1 …. n*n+1)/size Thats all, So without further ado, lets see the code. from constraint import * def solve_magic_square(size = 3): &quot;Get the magic square solution for any numbered square.&quot; magic = Problem()#create a blank problem rows = range(size)#Rows indices eg[0, 1, 2] cols = range(size)#cols indices eg [0, 1, 2] board_line_sum = sum(range(1, size*size+1))/size # What does each row, col and diag sum up to?
