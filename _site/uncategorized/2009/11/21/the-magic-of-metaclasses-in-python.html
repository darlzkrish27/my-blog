    <p>Metaclasses are a way for you to have a class act as the template for another class. They are simlar to a classfactory,
in that they create new classes. In words of Tim Peters <code class="highlighter-rouge">Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of people are going to need</code>.</p>

<p>However, in right hands they can be a potent tool, in particular Django uses metaclasses beautifully to create
very beautiful declarative models. Without further ado, here is a very simple (and very wrong) metaclass example.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Z(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs, ):
        print cls, name, bases, attrs
        
class A(object):
    __metaclass__ = Z
    
    
print A
print A()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this gives this output.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>shabda@shabda-laptop ~/docs&gt; python testmetaclass.py 
&lt;class '__main__.Z'&gt; A (&lt;type 'object'&gt;,) {'__module__': '__main__', '__metaclass__': &lt;class '__main__.Z'&gt;}
None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testmetaclass.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    print A()
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let what happened,</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">print cls, name, bases, attrs</code> got executed, even though we are not creating <code class="highlighter-rouge">Z</code> or calling it anywhere.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">print A</code> printed <code class="highlighter-rouge">None</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">print A()</code> failed with a traceback</li>
</ol>

<p>Lets try a slightly modified file,http://uswaretech.com/blog/2009/11/the-magic-of-metaclasses-in-python/</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Z(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs, ):
        return str
        
class A(object):
    __metaclass__ = Z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gives me,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print A
print A('Hello')

shabda@shabda-laptop ~/docs&gt; python testmetaclass.py 
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
Hello
shabda@shabda-laptop ~/docs&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output suggests that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is behaving like <code class="highlighter-rouge">str</code>. This should lead us to a few conclusions,</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a class has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">__metaclass__</code>, it is replaced by another class.</li>
  <li>The function called for creating the new class is <code class="highlighter-rouge">__new__</code>, it takes 4 parameters.</li>
  <li>cls is the metaclass being called, name is the name of the original class, bases are bases for original class, and attrs are attributes from original class.</li>
  <li>The old class is set to the value returned from <code class="highlighter-rouge">__metaclass__.__new__</code></li>
  <li>As we returned nothing in the first snippet, <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> was set to None. In second snippet it was set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">str</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an actual metaclass being used by Django.</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/240103.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li>In line 24, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Form. __metaclass__</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass</code> is a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">type</code>.</li>
  <li>It defines a method called as <code class="highlighter-rouge">__new__</code> which returns the newly created class.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that is all there is to metaclasses!</p>
