Read this first: <http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django>.

This is a great article by the Heroku. I am just filling in some more
details and making this step-by-step.

1.  Get your Django project code.
2.  Create a virtualenv with a no-site-packages command :

        virtualenv vent --no-site-packages

3.  Install Django, psycopg2 (postgres connector), gunicorn and any
    other required Django libraries.
4.  Confirm that you have all the required libraries and you can run
    your code locally using `manage.py runserver`.
5.  

    Create a requirement.txt by using

    :   pip freeze > requirements.txt

6.  Make sure you have a requirements.txt at the root of your repo.
    Heroku uses this to identify that the app is a Python app.
7.  Create a Procfile. Put this entry: :

        web: python mysite/manage.py run_gunicorn -b "0.0.0.0:$PORT" -w 3shabda

8.  This is what your directory structure will look like

    >     [root-of-heroku-folder]
    >         requirements.txt
    >         Procfile
    >         [Django-project-folder]
    >             __init__.py
    >             manage.py
    >             settings.py
    >             [app1]
    >             [app2]

9.  (If you aren\'t tracking your files with git yet.) Track your files
    with git. :

        git init
        git add .
        git commit -am "First commit"

10. Make sure you have the heroku toolbelt installed. If not go to
    <http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/> and install.

11.You should have these commands available now: :

    heroku
    foreman

12. Authenticate to heroku with

        heroku auth:login

13. Run this command. :

        heroku create --stack cedar    

This will create a new Heroku app and create a new remote in your git
repo.

14. Push your code to heroku. :

        git push heroku master

15. Your app should be working on Heroku now. `heroku open` will show
    your site.
