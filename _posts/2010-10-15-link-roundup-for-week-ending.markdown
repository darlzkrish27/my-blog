This is the first in a series of posts where we share links aggregated
from popular sources, tools we use, projects we work on, almost
everything related to web development and more\....

-   Django\'s got [HMAC
    signing](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/14218): These set
    of changes prevent timing-based attacks and are fully backwards
    compatible unless you\'ve a short SECRET\_KEY.
-   Django\'s got [more
    committers](http://djangodose.com/podcasts/community-catchup/episode/28/)
    and they are already hard at work!
-   The [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
    [tests](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/14139) have been
    upgraded to use the
    [unittest2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2) module. Phew!
    Lots of work has gone in the past couple of weeks. It just means one
    thing, the
    [1.3](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/sep/30/django-1_3-release-schedule/)
    alpha window is going to close soon. So hurry and unleash your
    ponies before it\'s too late but don\'t forget to thank the
    [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) developers for all the hard
    work!
-   On a slightly different note, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
    10.10, the latest release of our favourite operating system is out.
    Grab it and sudo apt-get super\_powers ;-)
-   [Check](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=438532093919) how
    Facebook is already using HTML 5 for the various parts of their
    site. If you are new to HTML5, you might want to check the awesome
    reference at [Dive into HTML 5](http://diveintohtml5.org/).
-   [jCarousel](http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/) is an easy to use jQuery
    plugin that moves items horizontally or vertically.
-   [Yahoo! Search Boss
    v2](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/coming-soon-–-yahoo-search-boss-v2-a-paid-service-with-web-images-and-news/)
    will be release in 2011 and the sad news is that it\'s going to be
    paid :( but it\'s going to get quite a few improvements.
-   A new version for the Google App Engine SDK has been released. Read
    [this](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-app-engine-sdk-138-includes-new.html)
    for more details.
-   A very well written article by Jesse Noller on [How to compete with
    google](http://jessenoller.com/2010/10/14/how-can-you-compete-with-google/).
    Must read for startups!
-   And lastly, we\'ve released [Djen of
    Django](http://github.com/agiliq/djenofdjango)
    ([html](http://agiliq.com/books/djenofdjango/)), a book whose goal
    is to teach [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) through
    practical examples. It\'s inspired from [James
    Bennett\'s](http://b-list.org/) [Practical Django
    Projects](http://apress.com/book/view/9781430219385) and is being
    written by [Javed](http://github.com/tuxcanfly). We love to hear
    from you on how you find it.

We value your feedback on this series. Happy weekend!
