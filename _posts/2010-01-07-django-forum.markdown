### twitter ready version:

We have released a [Django forum](http://uswaretech.com/forum/) application, with some cool features not in any other Django based forum. [You can get it here](http://github.com/uswaretech/Dinette) or [see it in action](http://uswaretech.com/forum/). 

### blog version

There are quite a few [Django based forum applications](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ForumAppsComparison), so why another? Its a bit of a rhetorical question,  as the answer is "none of them met my needs exactly, so we created my own", as you might expect.

Without further ado here is a list of features. It is available on [uswaretech.com/forum/](http://uswaretech.com/forum/).

*  Based on, inspired by and ripped from [PunBB](http://punbb.informer.com/). (Thanks!)
*  PunBB like 3 phased hierarchy [Forum]->Subforum->Topic->Post
*  Tightly integrated with [Socialauth](http://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth). (Screenshots)
*  [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/) support
*  Moderation features (Close, stikify, make announcement etc.)
*  Ajax based posting

We are starting our forums based on this app, so we plan to be supporting and developing this for foreseeable future. [Fork this on Github](http://github.com/uswaretech/Dinette) or [check this out now](http://uswaretech.com/forum/).
