This is announcement about our new work,  [Django Gotchas](http://djangogotchas.uswaretech.net/), a teeny tiny ebook about commonly occurring gotchas with Django. Here is the readme copied from the project.

-----

Django-gotchas is a collections of gotchas which happen commonly when you are working with Django.
They are some errors which I have made commonly or seen others do, these are not the errors which
happen because they are hard to reason about, these are those errors which hapen when you close your
eyes for a moment when coding.

------

This is still very much a work in progress, released in the spirit of release early, release often. Click here to get it, or fork it on [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/uswaretech/django-gotchas/)
