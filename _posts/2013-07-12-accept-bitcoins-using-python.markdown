In this blog post we'll talk about bitcoins and look at an overview of how to
accept them from your python app.

Bitcoin:
--------

Bitcoin is crypto-currency whose protocol allows fast, anonymous and secure
digital transactions.

To know more about bitcoin and to install it, go to the ["Developer
Guide"](http://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-developers) guide.

Getting started:
----------------

To get started, install bitcoin (assuming Ubuntu):

    $ sudo apt-get install bitcoind

Now edit `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` and add:

    testnet=1

This will allow us to run bitcoin in test mode.

Now start the `bitcoind` daemon using:

    $ bitcoind -daemon

To check that it's working, do:

    $ bitcoind getinfo

If you see a JSON output, you should be good to go.

Using JSON RPC:
---------------

Bitcoin includes a JSON RPC server as a part of the daemon.

Using a client library like
["bitcoin-python"](https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-python), we can invoke
bitcoin calls from python like so:

    >>> import bitcoinrpc
    >>> bitcoin = bitcoinrpc.connect_to_local()
    >>> bitcoin.getinfo()

Payment Flow:
-------------

In a standard payment flow, the steps involved would be:

* User checks out a shopping cart. Transaction starts.
* Generate a new bitcoin addres and ask the user to pay.
* Verify that payment is made, wait for confirmations if required.
* Generate invoice. Transaction ends.

Let's see how to do each of this step using the python client:

Generate a new bitcoin address:

    >>> add = bitcoin.getnewaddress()

Verify payment is made:

    >>> bitcoin.getreceivedbyaddress(add)

Get transcation info:

    >>> bitcoin.listtransactions(address=add)

Note: By default the RPC client waits for 1 confirmation, you can increase
this using the `minconf` argument to most API calls.

You can use a testnet faucet for testing:

[http://testnet.mojocoin.com/](http://testnet.mojocoin.com/)

When you're ready, you can switch the testnet mode in your bitcoinf.conf.

Security:
---------

You need to take precautions to make sure that your bitcoin wallet is secured
to prevent wallet theft, this is out of the scope of this tutorial, so please
