-   In [Washington
    Times\'](http://opensource.washingtontimes.com/blog/2010/nov/23/app-centric-django-development-part-1-introduction/)
    article on app-centric django development, they discuss the pros and
    cons of breaking your project into multiple apps.
-   [Luke
    Plant](http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/class-based-views-and-dry-ravioli/)
    writes how class based views in django views makes the code feel a
    bit like Ravioli (too many small classes with difficulty locating
    and identifying their functionality).
-   While we are at Ravioli, here is an interesting presentation about
    [\"How to stop writing Spaghetti
    code\"](http://www.slideshare.net/sh1mmer/how-to-stop-writing-spaghetti-code)
    in node.js.
-   [Eric
    Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/nov/17/using-haystack-index-non-database-content/)
    has a post on how to use Haystack search to index non-database
    content.
-   [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=454991608919)
    has written a blog post on \"The underlying technology of
    Messages\". Most of the projects are open-sourced. Interesting!
-   [Bing](http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2010/11/23/bing-engages-open-maps-community.aspx)
    has decided to contribute to the OpenStreeMap project. As a part of
    this initiative, they have hired Steve Coast (founder of OSM) and
    plan to open their Aerial imagery for use to OSM.
-   For all those who were left disappointed with Google\'s decision to
    discontinue Google Wave, there are plans by the company to
    [release](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Google-Wave-to-become-Apache-project-1141480.html)
    it as an Apache project.
-   [Tim
    Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/11/14/What-Android-Is)
    has an introductory article on \"What Android Is\". Easy read for a
    newbie.
-   \"Invent your own computer games with python\" in a [free
    eBook](http://inventwithpython.com/) that plans to teach the basic
    concepts of writing a game in Python. What makes this effort
    interesting? This book was written to be understandable by kids as
    young as 10 to 12 years old!
-   In probably the biggest news of the week,
    [Novell](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mergers-and-acquisitions/2010/11/23/novell-sold-to-attachmate-for-22bn-40090945/)
    has sold itself to Attachmate for a reported sum of \$2.2bn. Wonder
    who holds the copyrights for Unix now?
