Introduction:
-------------

PubSub is a XMPP extension which allows publishing and subscribing to
events. This is useful when you instantly want to notify many clients
about something interesting happening on your server.

Quoting the authors of [PubSub
specs](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html):

    The protocol enables XMPP entities to create nodes (topics) at a
    pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event
    notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all
    entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub therefore
    adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as
    the foundation for a wide variety of applications, including news
    feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow
    systems, network management systems, and any other application
    that requires event notifications.

To understand this better, think of newspapers as publishers and the
people who subscribe to the newspapers as subscribers. Getting your
daily newspaper is similar to checking your RSS feeds because you only
get information at regular intervals. (Of course you could keep buying
newspapers every \'x\' hours, i.e. keep refreshing your RSS reader so
often). This is as inefficient as it sounds. For instance, you never
know if a newspaper actually has new stuff, you need to buy and read it
before you realize there\'s nothing new. And there will be always be a
delay (unless you are really lucky) between the time something happens
and you read it in the your \'n\'th newspaper of the day.

PubSub solves this problem by having a system where subscribers
subscribe to nodes and the publisher notifies its subscribers when
something happens. Nodes are like TV channels, so you only subscribe to
the channels you are interested in.

How it can be useful to you:
----------------------------

In addition to the points mentioned in the quote, pubSub can be used in
your project to send instant notifications, maintain the same state
across multiple sessions, or monitor live activity.

Introducing django-pubsub:
--------------------------

[django-pubsub](https://github.com/agiliq/django-pubsub) allows you
write PubSub enabled applications easily.

[This demo](http://chat.agiliq.com/pubsub/) using django-pubsub shows
how to use the module. The stack used in the demo is:

-   fcgi
-   nginx
-   ejabberd with mod\_http\_bind and mod\_pubsub

You can register a model with the pubsub app and all registered models
will automatically send out notification (with the payload) on `save` to
the default node.

Then you can use the PubSub client provided in `media` to subscribe and
receive events from the registered models.

The default payload includes an XML serialized instance of the model.
You can use jquery to extract required `fields` from the payload.

You can also directly use `pubsub.publish` to publish any item to any
node. An example is provided in the demo included with the app.

How it works:
-------------

Since XMPP and HTTP speak different languages, you need some kind of a
bridge to connect these two. This can be achieved using
[BOSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOSH).

The BOSH bridge is provided by ejabberd\'s `mod_http_bind` module. (You
can also use [Punjab](https://github.com/twonds/punjab) for this
purpose)

If you are using mod\_http\_bind, you will also need to setup
appropriate url forwarding using nginx because mod\_http\_bind listens
on the port 5280 and will not be able to communicate with the client on
port 8080.

Strophe will use the BOSH url to talk to ejabberd. Our PubSub client
which is written using Strophe will then be able to subscribe and
receive notifications from the server.

On the server side, the pubsub app uses xmpppy to send out the correct
`Iq` stanzas on `save` or `publish`. The client will receive these
stanzas on subscribing to the appropriate node.

Conclusion:
-----------

If your app needs real-time updates, push notifications, and scalable
infrastructure, you can make use of XMPP and Strophejs.
